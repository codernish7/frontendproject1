                <h2>Lara Croft</h2><hr>
                <article>Lara Croft is an English archaeologist and the protagonist of Crystal Dynamics' second reboot timeline.
                    Unlike other timelines, Lara is in the formative years of her career, expanding her already extensive knowledge
                    and skill set and becoming a hardened survivalist and deadly combatant. Lara's new "realistic and "more human" portrayal has led to several comparisons to the character Nathan Drake, the protagonist of the Uncharted series, which was created by Amy Hennig, who is a former employee of Crystal Dynamics, and writer and director of the Legacy of Kain series.

                <h2>Jonah Maiava</h2><hr>
                <article>Jonah was born in New Zealand, but raised in Hawaii by his maternal grandmother. Based on one of his journal entries acquired in the game, passing on knowledge and traditions is a practice normal in Polynesian families.

                    His father was abusive when he was young, causing Jonah and his brother to often hide from him. 
                    
                    As a young man, he traveled back to his home country to serve in the New Zealand Army. His strength and almost supernatural ability to detect danger made him a popular member of his unit; his ability to prepare and cook almost anything didn't hurt either.</article>

                <h2>Unuratu</h2><hr>
                <article>Queen Unuratu is the rightful ruler of the hidden city of Paititi. She inherited the throne after the death of her husband, King Sayri, but was usurped by Amaru, Sayri's brother and the High Priest of the Cult of Kukulkan. She has since become the leader of a faction of loyalist Paititians who desire to overthrow the Cult and end its centuries of oppression.

                    She is a supporting character in Shadow of the Tomb Raider.</article>

                <h2>Dr. Pedro Dominguez</h2><hr>
                <article>The man who would be known as Pedro Dominguez was born as Amaru in the hidden city of Paititi in the 1960s. He was the older brother of Sayri, who became King of Paititi. As a child Amaru was quiet and studious. Amaru and Sayri were adventurous together, and had a secret hideout in the mountains.

                    While still a child, Amaru fell in with the Cult of Kukulkan, a proxy for Trinity that had manipulated Paititi's rulers since 1603 AD, and was eventually brought out of the city into the outside world.</article>
